# Interval-Compiler-Front-End
A simple compiler front-end for doing interval arithmetic operations using GNU Bison &amp; Flex and C++ as backend.

## Task
- Understanding how to use Flex & Bison, the arithmetic interval class/calculations didn't have to be too complicated due to time constraints, although I would have loved to delve into it a bit more.

## Resources that helped me tremendously:
- [sunxfancy's examples](https://github.com/sunxfancy/flex-bison-examples)
- [GNU Bison manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/)
- [Flex manual](https://westes.github.io/flex/manual/)
